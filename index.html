            <h5>Breakdown of the elevator mechanism:</h5>
            <p>
                Elevator can be operated from the inside by the 
                control panel in the cabin or by the buttons located 
                on every floor from the outside of the elevator. (Note 
                that ground floor has number 1.)
            </p>
            <p>
                When the elevator is waiting for passengers to 
                enter the cabin or is moving towards/with currect user, 
                no other person can call it at the same time. That is 
                indicated by lights on every floor - they can't push the 
                "call" button while they're lighten up. (Surely they can, 
                but nothing will happen.)
            </p>
            <p>
                If the elevator stands still, anyone from outside can operate it. 
                If it's on the same floor then the door will open. If not, elevator 
                will come directly to caller and open door automatically. Then, the 
                passenger has 3 seconds to enter desired floor. If no one enters the 
                cabin and dial his choice, door will automatically close themselves and 
                elevator will be ready to be called from any floor.
            </p>

            <h5>Usage instructions:</h5>
            <p>
                1. Click on the floor button you're calling from (- on the right side when using desktop, at the bottom while being on the phone). <br>
                2. When elevator arrives at your floor and opens its door, select the desired destination in the inside of the cabin.<br>
                3. When doors are opened, you can operate it from inside as many times as you want.<br>
                4. When calling buttons aren't lit up, you can call it by using them.
            </p>

            <h5>Notes on styling my code:</h5>
            <p>
                For any potencial codeReader: <br>
                1. Please don't mind tabulated functions in purpose to esthetically 
                enhance source code. <br>
                2. Every comment under the function's signature is describing overall 
                behaviour of the function. <br>
            </p>
            <h5>Notes on visual design:</h5>
            <p>
                This sketch has only one purpose - to show functionality of this 
                implemented elevator algorithm. It hasn't been properly designed to be 
                visually appealing, because, I'm not gonna lie, I have no ability to 
                do that. Art isn't my passion, I'm here for technical reasoning.
