Readme file to be updated

## Development notes:
FOLDERS' CONTENT:
- app: JavaScript working files
- js: babel-compiled files

- scss: CSS working files
- css: Sass-compiled files

Make sure not to touch code in folders updated automatically. Rather manipulate only working files & then run compilation of modified structures.
